# Periodic Weather Analytics

About one month after the release of the [Periodic Weather PWA](https://github.com/vaneenige/periodic-weather) it's time for something new. Many unique locations have been added worldwide and web push notifications with weather information have reached people a lot of times. This Progressive Web App was created to deliver an overview of all the added locations with their current weather status while exploring the challenges that come with it during development to keep performance high.
